# Git Guide

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that helps manage changes to code or files over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work, and it tracks all the changes made to the project.

## Basic Git Concepts

- **Repository (repo)**: A directory where Git tracks your project files. There are two types of repositories:
  - **Local repository**: A repository stored on your local machine.
  - **Remote repository**: A repository stored on a remote server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
  
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a particular point in time. Each commit is like a version of your code.
  
- **Branch**: A separate line of development. Git allows you to create branches to work on features or fixes independently of the main project.
  
- **Clone**: Creating a local copy of a remote repository.
  
- **Push**: Uploading your local changes to a remote repository.
  
- **Pull**: Downloading the latest changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
  
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches.

## Basic Git Operations with Examples

### 1. Install Git

Before using Git, you need to install it. Here's how:

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

#### On CentOS/RHEL:

```bash
sudo yum install git
```

#### On macOS:

```bash
brew install git
```

#### On Windows:
Download and install Git from git-scm.com.

## 2. Set up Git (First Time Use)
After installing Git, you should configure your username and email (which will be used to identify your commits):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

To verify your configuration:

```bash
git config --list
```

## 3. Creating a Repository (Repo)
You can create a new Git repository either locally or by cloning an existing repository.

*Initialize a new local repository:*

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
```

Clone a remote repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

## 4. Tracking Changes
Git tracks the changes you make to files within a repository. Let's look at some key Git operations related to tracking changes.

Check repository status:
To see which files have changed or are untracked:

```bash
git status
```

*Add files to staging area:*
You need to add files to the "staging area" before committing them. Use git add to stage changes.

Add a single file:

```bash
git add filename.txt
```

Add all changes (new, modified, deleted files):

```bash
git add .
```

*Commit changes:*
Once files are staged, commit the changes. Commits save the current state of the staged files.

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```

## 5. Viewing History
You can view the history of commits made to a repository.

Show the commit history:

```bash
git log
```

This displays a list of commits with their SHA-1 hash, author, date, and commit message.

*To view a concise history:*

```bash
git log --oneline
```

*Show changes in a commit:*
To see the exact changes made in a commit:

```bash
git show <commit_hash>
```

## 6. Working with Branches
Branches allow you to work on separate features or fixes without affecting the main project.

*Create a new branch:*

```bash
git branch branch-name
```

*Switch to another branch:*

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

*Create and switch to a new branch in one command:*

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

*List all branches:*

```bash
git branch
```

*Merge branches:*
After finishing work on a branch, you can merge it back into another branch (usually main or master):

```bash
git checkout main
git merge branch-name
```

*Delete a branch (after merging):*

```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

## 7. Collaborating with a Remote Repository

*Cloning a Remote Repository:*
To create a local copy of an existing repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

*Fetching Latest Changes from Remote:*
Fetch changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git fetch
```

This updates your local copy with changes from the remote without merging them.

*Pull changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch:*

```bash
git pull
```

Example:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

*Pushing Changes to Remote:*
After committing locally, you can push your changes to the remote repository.

Push your changes to the remote:

```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

Example:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

## 8. Handling Conflicts
Conflicts occur when two branches modify the same part of the same file. Git will try to merge automatically, but if it can't, you'll have to resolve the conflict manually.

*Merge conflict resolution:*
When a conflict happens, Git will mark the conflicting sections in the file with markers:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Changes from the branch being merged
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

You must manually edit the file to resolve the conflict and then add it to the staging area:

```bash
git add filename.txt
```

Continue the merge after resolving conflicts:

```bash
git commit
```

## 9. Undoing Changes
Undo changes to a file (before committing):
If you want to discard local changes in a file (i.e., revert the file to the last commit):

```bash
git checkout -- filename.txt
```

*Undo a commit (after committing but before pushing):*
If you want to undo the last commit but keep the changes:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

If you want to undo the commit and discard the changes:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## 10. Stashing Changes
Sometimes, you may have unfinished changes but need to switch branches. You can stash your changes and apply them later.

*Stash your changes:*

```bash
git stash
```

*List stashed changes:*

```bash
git stash list
```

*Apply stashed changes:*

```bash
git stash apply
```

*Drop a stash (if you no longer need it):*

```bash
git stash drop
```

# Git Workflows
There are different ways to work with Git, depending on how the team uses it. Here are some common workflows:

*1. Centralized Workflow*
In this workflow, you and your team all push to and pull from a shared remote branch (often main or master).

Fetch latest changes:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Push changes:

```bash
git push origin main
```

*2. Feature Branch Workflow*
This is a common workflow where each new feature gets its own branch.

Create a new branch for each feature:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

After completing the feature, merge it back into main:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

*3. Forking Workflow*
In open-source development, contributors fork a repository, create feature branches, and then submit pull requests.

- Fork the repository on GitHub.

- Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git
```

- Create a feature branch, commit, and push changes.

- Create a pull request to the original repository.

# Conclusion
This guide covers the essential Git operations you'll need to know to start using Git for version control. Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the most common operations:

`git init`: Initialize a new repository.
`git clone <repo>`: Clone a repository.
`git status`: Check the status of the repository.
`git add <file>`: Stage changes.
`git commit -m "message"`: Commit changes.
`git pull`: Pull changes from the remote repository.
`git push`: Push local commits to the remote.
`git branch`: Create and manage branches.
`git merge`: Merge branches.
`git log`: View commit history.

These are the fundamental concepts of using Git. There are more advanced features and commands, but mastering these basics will allow you to effectively use Git in most scenarios.
