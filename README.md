# Git Guide

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that helps manage changes to code or files over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work, and it tracks all the changes made to the project.

## Basic Git Concepts

- **Repository (repo)**: A directory where Git tracks your project files. There are two types of repositories:
  - **Local repository**: A repository stored on your local machine.
  - **Remote repository**: A repository stored on a remote server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
  
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a particular point in time. Each commit is like a version of your code.
  
- **Branch**: A separate line of development. Git allows you to create branches to work on features or fixes independently of the main project.
  
- **Clone**: Creating a local copy of a remote repository.
  
- **Push**: Uploading your local changes to a remote repository.
  
- **Pull**: Downloading the latest changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
  
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches.

## Basic Git Operations with Examples

### 1. Install Git

Before using Git, you need to install it. Here's how:

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

#### On CentOS/RHEL:

```bash
sudo yum install git
```

#### On macOS:

```bash
brew install git
```

#### On Windows:
Download and install Git from git-scm.com.

## 2. Set up Git (First Time Use)
After installing Git, you should configure your username and email (which will be used to identify your commits):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

To verify your configuration:

```bash
git config --list
```

## 3. Creating a Repository (Repo)
You can create a new Git repository either locally or by cloning an existing repository.

*Initialize a new local repository:*

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
```

Clone a remote repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

## 4. Tracking Changes
Git tracks the changes you make to files within a repository. Let's look at some key Git operations related to tracking changes.

Check repository status:
To see which files have changed or are untracked:

```bash
git status
```

*Add files to staging area:*
You need to add files to the "staging area" before committing them. Use git add to stage changes.

Add a single file:

```bash
git add filename.txt
```

Add all changes (new, modified, deleted files):

```bash
git add .
```

*Commit changes:*
Once files are staged, commit the changes. Commits save the current state of the staged files.

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```

## 5. Viewing History
You can view the history of commits made to a repository.

Show the commit history:

```bash
git log
```

This displays a list of commits with their SHA-1 hash, author, date, and commit message.

*To view a concise history:*

```bash
git log --oneline
```

*Show changes in a commit:*
To see the exact changes made in a commit:

```bash
git show <commit_hash>
```

## 6. Working with Branches
Branches allow you to work on separate features or fixes without affecting the main project.

*Create a new branch:*

```bash
git branch branch-name
```

*Switch to another branch:*

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

*Create and switch to a new branch in one command:*

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

*List all branches:*

```bash
git branch
```

*Merge branches:*
After finishing work on a branch, you can merge it back into another branch (usually main or master):

```bash
git checkout main
git merge branch-name
```

*Delete a branch (after merging):*

```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

## 7. Collaborating with a Remote Repository

*Cloning a Remote Repository:*
To create a local copy of an existing repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

*Fetching Latest Changes from Remote:*
Fetch changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git fetch
```

This updates your local copy with changes from the remote without merging them.

*Pull changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch:*

```bash
git pull
```

Example:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

*Pushing Changes to Remote:*
After committing locally, you can push your changes to the remote repository.

Push your changes to the remote:

```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

Example:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

## 8. Handling Conflicts
Conflicts occur when two branches modify the same part of the same file. Git will try to merge automatically, but if it can't, you'll have to resolve the conflict manually.

*Merge conflict resolution:*
When a conflict happens, Git will mark the conflicting sections in the file with markers:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Changes from the branch being merged
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

You must manually edit the file to resolve the conflict and then add it to the staging area:

```bash
git add filename.txt
```

Continue the merge after resolving conflicts:

```bash
git commit
```

## 9. Undoing Changes
Undo changes to a file (before committing):
If you want to discard local changes in a file (i.e., revert the file to the last commit):

```bash
git checkout -- filename.txt
```

*Undo a commit (after committing but before pushing):*
If you want to undo the last commit but keep the changes:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

If you want to undo the commit and discard the changes:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## 10. Stashing Changes
Sometimes, you may have unfinished changes but need to switch branches. You can stash your changes and apply them later.

*Stash your changes:*

```bash
git stash
```

*List stashed changes:*

```bash
git stash list
```

*Apply stashed changes:*

```bash
git stash apply
```

*Drop a stash (if you no longer need it):*

```bash
git stash drop
```

# Git Workflows
There are different ways to work with Git, depending on how the team uses it. Here are some common workflows:

*1. Centralized Workflow*
In this workflow, you and your team all push to and pull from a shared remote branch (often main or master).

Fetch latest changes:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Push changes:

```bash
git push origin main
```

*2. Feature Branch Workflow*
This is a common workflow where each new feature gets its own branch.

Create a new branch for each feature:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

After completing the feature, merge it back into main:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

*3. Forking Workflow*
In open-source development, contributors fork a repository, create feature branches, and then submit pull requests.

- Fork the repository on GitHub.

- Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git
```

- Create a feature branch, commit, and push changes.

- Create a pull request to the original repository.

# Conclusion
This guide covers the essential Git operations you'll need to know to start using Git for version control. Here’s a quick summary of the most common operations:

`git init`: Initialize a new repository.
`git clone <repo>`: Clone a repository.
`git status`: Check the status of the repository.
`git add <file>`: Stage changes.
`git commit -m "message"`: Commit changes.
`git pull`: Pull changes from the remote repository.
`git push`: Push local commits to the remote.
`git branch`: Create and manage branches.
`git merge`: Merge branches.
`git log`: View commit history.

These are the fundamental concepts of using Git. There are more advanced features and commands, but mastering these basics will allow you to effectively use Git in most scenarios.


# GitHub: A Comprehensive Guide
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control.
It provides a collaborative space for developers to store and share their code with others.
GitHub is especially popular for hosting open-source projects but is also widely used by companies and individual developers for personal projects.
GitHub integrates Git with a variety of features designed to streamline team collaboration, code sharing, and project management.

*1. What is GitHub?*
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories.
It allows multiple people to contribute to the same project, track changes, and manage code using Git's version control features, but it also provides extra tools like pull requests, issues, wikis, and project management boards.

GitHub hosts your Git repositories and provides a graphical interface for you to interact with your repositories, making collaboration easier and providing features like:
- Remote storage for Git repositories.
- Collaboration: multiple users can work on the same codebase, submit changes, and review each other's work.
- Issue tracking: developers can track bugs, feature requests, or any other tasks.
- Pull requests: a way to propose changes to the codebase and review those changes before merging.
- GitHub Actions: continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for automating testing and deployment.

*2. Creating a GitHub Account*
To use GitHub, you first need to sign up for an account:

- Visit https://github.com/.
- Click on Sign up to create a new account.
- Fill in the required details, such as username, email, and password.
- Follow the verification process to confirm your email.
- Once you're logged in, you can start creating repositories and collaborating with others.

*3. Creating a New Repository on GitHub*
A repository (or "repo") is where your project’s code and history are stored. 
You can create a repository on GitHub by following these steps:

- Log in to GitHub.
- On the GitHub homepage, click on the + sign (top-right corner), and select New repository.
- Fill in the repository name and optionally add a description.
- Choose the visibility:
  - Public: Anyone can see the repository.
  - Private: Only people you invite can access it.
- Optionally, you can initialize the repository with a README file, a .gitignore file (for excluding files from being tracked by Git), and a license.
- Click on Create repository.

*4. Cloning a Repository from GitHub*
To get a local copy of a GitHub repository on your machine, you "clone" the repository.

- Navigate to the repository page on GitHub.
- Click on the Code button, and copy the URL (either HTTPS or SSH).
- Open your terminal and type the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

This command creates a local copy of the repository on your computer.


*5. GitHub Workflow: Pushing and Pulling Changes*
Once you've cloned a repository or created a new one, you can make changes locally and then push them to GitHub.

Making Changes Locally:
Create or modify files in your repository on your local machine.

Stage the changes:

```bash
git add <file-name>    # To add a specific file
git add .              # To add all changes in the repository
```

Commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

Push Changes to GitHub:
Once you've committed your changes, push them to the remote repository (GitHub):

```bash
git push origin main    # Pushes to the main branch (or master)
```

Pulling Changes from GitHub:
To get the latest changes from GitHub into your local repository (in case others have made changes):

```bash
git pull origin main    # Pulls changes from the main branch
```

*6. Branching and Merging*
In a collaborative environment, you typically create branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch (main or master).

Create a New Branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch  # Create and switch to a new branch
```

Push Your Branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

Merge a Branch:
Once you've completed the changes in your branch, you can merge it back into the main branch.

First, switch to the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Merge the feature branch into main:

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

Push the merged changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

*7. Pull Requests*
Pull Requests (PRs) are how developers propose changes to a repository. A pull request is a request to merge one branch (usually a feature branch) into another (usually main).

*Creating a Pull Request:*

1. After pushing your branch to GitHub, go to the repository page on GitHub.
2. GitHub will often prompt you to create a pull request for the newly pushed branch.
3. If not, go to the Pull requests tab and click on New pull request.
4. Select the base branch (usually main) and compare it with the branch you want to merge.
5. Add a description of the changes you made.
6. Click Create pull request.
   
*Reviewing a Pull Request:*

Team members or collaborators can comment, approve, or request changes on your pull request.
Once it's approved, someone (either you or someone else) can merge it into the main branch.

*8. GitHub Issues*
GitHub Issues allow you to track bugs, tasks, or feature requests. Each issue has a title, description, and can be assigned to specific people.

*Creating an Issue:*

1. Go to the Issues tab in your repository.
2. Click on New issue.
3. Fill in the title, description, and assign the issue to someone if necessary.
4. Submit the issue.

*Referencing Issues in Commit Messages:*
You can refer to issues directly in commit messages by using #issue_number.

For example:

```bash
git commit -m "Fixes #42 - Address issue with login bug"
```

This automatically links the commit to issue number 42, making it easier to track which commit fixes which issue.

*9. Forking Repositories*
Forking is used to create your own copy of someone else's repository. You can then make changes to your forked repository without affecting the original repository. Forking is common for contributing to open-source projects.

*How to Fork a Repository:*
1. Go to the repository you want to fork.
2. Click on the Fork button (top-right corner).
3. Select where you want to fork it (your own account or an organization).

*Working with a Fork:*
1. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
2. Make changes and commit them.
3. Push changes to your forked repository.
4. Create a Pull Request from your fork to the original repository (this is how you propose changes).
   
*10. Collaborating with GitHub*
GitHub makes collaboration easy through Teams, Organizations, and Collaborators. These features allow you to:

- Add collaborators to your repository (for private repositories).
- Create teams in organizations with specific permissions.
- Grant or restrict access to various parts of a repository.
  
*11. GitHub Actions*
GitHub Actions is GitHub's automation tool that allows you to set up workflows to automate tasks like testing, building, and deploying your code. You define actions in YAML files.

- Creating a simple action:
  1. Create a .github/workflows directory in your repo.
  2. Add a YAML file (e.g., ci.yml).
  3. Define the actions to run (e.g., run tests, deploy code).

Example action:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

*12. GitHub Pages*
GitHub Pages allows you to host websites directly from a GitHub repository.

1. Create a repository named `username.github.io`.
2. Push your website files to this repository.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.

*Conclusion*
GitHub is a powerful platform for managing and collaborating on code, offering features that extend the functionality of Git and make teamwork easier. Here's a recap of the major features covered:

*Repository*: A place to store your code.
*Clone*: Copy a repository to your local machine.
*Commit*: Save changes to the repository.
*Push*: Upload changes to GitHub.
*Pull*: Fetch the latest changes from GitHub.
*Branch*: Work on a separate line of development.
*Merge*: Combine changes from different branches.
*Pull Requests*: Propose and review changes.
*Issues*: Track bugs, tasks, or features.
*Forking*: Create your own copy of a repository to make changes.
*GitHub Actions*: Automate tasks like testing and deployment.
*GitHub Pages*: Host websites directly from repositories.
Mastering GitHub alongside Git will greatly enhance your workflow, especially when collaborating with teams or contributing to open-source projects!
